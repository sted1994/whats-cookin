## Overview: 
What's Cookin' is an app to help find recipes and plan what to cook. A user can either search for a specific tag or title, or they can browse recipes in each tag or all the recipes available. Once the user has chosen a recipe they would like to try, they are able to add it to their 'To Cook' list. If there is a recipe they like and would like to keep easily accessable, they can add it to their 'Favorites' list. If their favorites list gets long, they can serch within their favorites to find what they are looking for. Additionally, if the user decides they no longer want a recipe in their favorites, they can delete it.
